# 🚦 pytorch-conditional-gan
### About
I'm making a conditional GAN to learn more about Pytorch, figuring things out as I go. 

Currently, I'm using the [Sign Language MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) dataset for my model. 

Generating hands has long been a weekness of AI. However my hope is that once this thing done, it will be able to generate hands that somewhat resemble the real gestures based on a given label.
